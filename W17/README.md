Well I was having a difficult time understanding the code because I was getting an unresolved error that I have now fixed. My understanding of the code is that we have 3 current JS files. 1 is our main and the other 2 are modules that have seperate running code. One is to create the table and the other is to calculate the total amount of carbon footprint points for the user. When the user enters their data, that data is stored until it is referenced in the code and use in the table. We import the 2 modules, give global constants for the output and the submission form and our other data. This is then calculated in the cpf.js module. We then use that data and input that into our table and display for the user. 

I thought your walkthrough was the most helpful. I was very  much stuck on the coding challenges and it was causing me to be very frustrated and behind so thank you so much. 
 

 W8:


My thought process for editing the data is letting the user re-enter it into the form after they press edit. This seems to me like the most logical course of action. 

W9: Local storage of data is pretty important when it comes to forms such as the one we have created. If they enter information and the page reloads or such we want to make sure that the data is stored somewhere. I have a grasp of the functions with stringifying the data so that it saves to the storage so it can be later manipulated, but I feel like I will understand it more during the code along


W10: The example that was given honestly made me understand functions better than I did before. I was able to really get a better grasp on my understanding
