Well I was having a difficult time understanding the code because I was getting an unresolved error that I have now fixed. My understanding of the code is that we have 3 current JS files. 1 is our main and the other 2 are modules that have seperate running code. One is to create the table and the other is to calculate the total amount of carbon footprint points for the user. When the user enters their data, that data is stored until it is referenced in the code and use in the table. We import the 2 modules, give global constants for the output and the submission form and our other data. This is then calculated in the cpf.js module. We then use that data and input that into our table and display for the user. 

I thought your walkthrough was the most helpful. I was very  much stuck on the coding challenges and it was causing me to be very frustrated and behind so thank you so much.

My thought process for editing the data is letting the user re-enter it into the form after they press edit. This seems to me like the most logical course of action.
